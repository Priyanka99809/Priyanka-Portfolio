             <h1> Why should you code?..</h1>
             <p>A lot of people before entering the programming field are curious to know how things work behind the scene?
             How within a few seconds Google give us a search result for whatever we are looking for?
              How we are able to connect to someone on Facebook around this world?
              
              How does Google Maps really work to give us direction anywhere in this world? 
              All the above reasons inspire a non-programmer to choose this field. Today we all are dependent on technology in our daily life,
              for entertainment, for communication, and for everything but very few people know how to read and write code. 
              If you are already coding for years, you will be able to apply this skill beyond your computers.
            
              We are surrounded by a lot of problems and coding has given us a lot of solutions in the real world. 
              It doesn’t matter if you are a non-programmer, beginner, or experienced person, 
              there are multiple reasons you should learn to code.
